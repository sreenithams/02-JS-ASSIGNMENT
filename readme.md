JavaScript
Assignment-2


 1.What are the variable naming conventions in JavaScript?

      Variable names must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). They cannot start with a number or any other special characters
      Case sensitivity: Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that myVariable, MyVariable, and MYVARIABLE are considered different variables
      Characters: After the first character, variable names can include any combination of letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs
      No spaces: Spaces are not allowed within variable name 
      Reserved words: JavaScript reserved keywords cannot be used as variable names.
      
 2.Create a greeting alert (use => prompt, message, alert)
 ```js
      let name = prompt("Enter Your Name")
      let message = ("Goodmorning ")
      alert(`${message} ${name}`)
```
 3. Write some code so that the values of the below variables switch around 
    Let a = 5, let b = 8. Switch the value so that a holds the value 8 and the variable b holds the value 5
```js
let a=11
let b=5
let c=b
b=a
a=c
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
```
